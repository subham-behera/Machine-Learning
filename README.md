# Machine-Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that can learn from and make predictions on data. Linear regression is also a type of machine-learning algorithm more specifically a supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labeled datasets and maps the data points to the most optimized linear functions. which can be used for prediction on new datasets.

First of we should know what is supervised machine learning algorithms. It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. Labeled data means the dataset whose respective target value is already known. Supervised learning has two types:

Classification: It predicts the class of the dataset based on the independent input variable. Class is the categorical or discrete values. like the image of an animal is a cat or dog?

Regression: It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable. like the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.


## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/subham-behera/machine-learning.git
    cd machine-learning
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   

## Running the Notebooks

To run the Jupyter notebooks for each algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Navigate to the desired algorithm directory** (e.g., `KNN classifier`) and open the respective notebook.

## Algorithms and Techniques

1. **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into k groups based on feature similarity.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.
3. **Linear Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear function.
4. **Logistic Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It models the probability of a discrete outcome based on one or more independent variables.
5. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning models that consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). They are used for a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and more complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
