# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that can learn from and make predictions on data. Linear regression is also a type of machine-learning algorithm more specifically a supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labeled datasets and maps the data points to the most optimized linear functions. which can be used for prediction on new datasets. 

First of we should know what is supervised machine learning algorithms. It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data.  Labeled data means the dataset whose respective target value is already known. Supervised learning has two types:

Classification: It predicts the class of the dataset based on the independent input variable. Class is the categorical or discrete values. like the image of an animal is a cat or dog?

Regression: It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable. like the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.
