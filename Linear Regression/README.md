LINEAR REGRESSION
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship 
between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. When the number of the independent feature, 
is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in the case of more than one feature, it is 
known as multivariate linear regression. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that 
can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation provides a 
straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of 
the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).

One of the most important supervised learning tasks is regression. In regression set of records are present 
with X and Y values and these values are used to learn a function so if you want to predict Y from an unknown
X this learned function can be used. In regression we have to find the value of Y, So, a function is required 
that predicts continuous Y in the case of regression given X as independent features.

Here Y is called a dependent or target variable and X is called an independent variable also known as the 
predictor of Y. There are many types of functions or modules that can be used for regression. A linear function 
is the simplest type of function.
